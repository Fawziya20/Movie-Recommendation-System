### Introduction
Our task is to design a datawarehouse with the sources of data which may include from external sources such as movie ratings from websites like IMDb as well as user profiles and viewing history.
Using ETL process(Extract,Transform and Load) the data from the various sources are stored into the data warehouse.
Python has many libraries for creating visulaizations such as Matplotlib,Plotly or Seaborn.
